# project_manager

A small javascript project to manage your node js projects

## Installation

1. Clone project ( `git clone https://github.com/Greensky-gs/project_manager` )

> ⚠️ You have to clone the project in the same emplacement where you have all your projects
> For example, I have a `js` folder, containing `DraverIndustries`, `misc`, `teaching` and some more. Now, it contains `DraverIndustries`, `misc`, `teaching` **and** `project_manager`

## Usage

Use the `yarn start` command, and you will have a command line interface to remove the projects you don't need anymore.
